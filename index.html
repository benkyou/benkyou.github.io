            Welcome to Benkyou, we're a site dedicated in helping you Learn Japanese. We're not a replacement site for things like Duolingo
            or Memrise, rather, we have resources that we collocate to help you learn the content of these text books and
            websites. Most of our content is sourced by the community if not created by ourselves, if you're interested in
            helping us out, check us out on Patreon, <a href="https://patreon.com/benkyou">here</a>.
            <br><br>Check out our resources below.
            <br><br>&mdash; Benkyou

            Learning specific vocabulary can be an absolute pain, we know that. This site is designed to constantly throw Japanese vocabulary
            at you (in specific lists) so that you can memorise there and on the spot! Often we use it for learning subtle
            differences between words, as thats probably one of the most painful things about learning a new language!
